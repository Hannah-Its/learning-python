# Day 1 â€“ Variables & Data Types

Today I learned:
- How to store user input in variables using `input()`
- The difference between `int`, `float`, and `str`
- How to convert strings to floats using `float()`
- How to check the type of a variable with `type()`
- How to format output using f-strings

I also completed a small script that asks for name, age, and favorite number, and works with different data types.
